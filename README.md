### - Sample
  There are three types of `Samples` such as `Private`, `Shared` and `Public` Samples. 
  `Private Sample` is the *Samples* that only me can view and edit. <br />
  In `Shared Sample`, I'm an *Investigator* or *Collaborator*. <br />
  In `Public Sample`, I'm an *Curator* or *Owner*.

## FAQs

 ### About Sample Exchange (SE)

    Is Sample Exchange only for science and scientists?

Not at all, but this is how the project originated. We are absolutely open to suggestions for non-science products and projects. Drop us an email at [member-support@sample.exchange](mailto:member-support@sample.exchange)
.

### Using Sample Exchange
    1. What can Sample Exchange be used for?

Sample Exchange is a web-based platform that allows you to share and license almost any research product you have developed, collected or synthesized. This can include chemical small-molecule libraries, to rock samples, to even images. Users will also be able to share “electronic” data products in the future.

    2. Is Sample Exchange free to use?

Yes! We do charge a nominal fee to create and hold your legal agreements (fees vary by country). We will soon be offering users an opportunity to create a “sample store”, where you can license or sell your samples. Storefronts are not free unless we offer them for free under special circumstances.

    3. How do I start using Sample Exchange? What do I do to advertise my sample collection?

Using the add sample features, upload data about your samples, such as when it was collected or developed, its prominent features, how it is stored, and other attributes. SE will make your data searchable and allow other users and customers to find your samples.
After you finish adding samples, you can group them by creating different sets and share the workflow across your colleagues by adding collaborators to samples and sets.

    4. How do I add details for a sample?

You can either add the sample individually or upload bulk data with excel. We provide templates for you to fill in your sample data and upload it on the platform. If your sample doesn’t conform to the existing templates, write to us and we’ll create a custom template for you.

    5. I have a large collection of samples, but I don’t want to add all of them. How can this be made easy for me?

While adding your samples in bulk, you can choose to skip the samples that you don’t want to add on the platform. You can even select certain columns and make samples private or public at the time of bulk export so you don’t have to manually sift through all the samples to make changes.

    6. Can I add data for human samples?

Yes. Please see special note 1 below.

    7. Can I add a collection of samples that may be infectious to humans (such as viruses and bacteria)?

Yes, please see special notes 2 and 3 below.

    8. What about sample quality? Do you have any guidelines?

We don’t have explicit guidelines around sample quality, but would strongly prefer if you can show peer review through publications or external use, such as by a collaborator or any third party who may be already using your samples. We realize, of course, that this is not possible for all collections, especially new ones, so feel free to upload all your data. If you have a question, feel free to reach us at [member-support@sample.exchange](mailto:member-support@sample.exchange) for personalized assistance.


### Sharing/licensing questions

    1. I would like to license my samples to a collaborator or a third party, but I am not familiar with any legal procedures that may be needed. Can you help me?

Not to worry. We have made the process of licensing and sharing very simple for new and first-time users. Just use our wizard to create a legal material transfer agreement that you and your collaborator can sign. You may have to get approval from your university or the person who owns the collection (in case you are working on someone’s behalf). Once you sign, you are ready to share your samples!

    2. What does it mean by “making samples public”?

Public samples are those for which all details are made public. This does not imply the samples are free. In some cases, the user may choose to offer them to you for free (good for you!).

    3. Are there some kinds of samples I am not allowed to share?

Rules around sharing and export control are different for each country. We encourage you to contact a legal firm or an attorney/lawyer if you are not sure. See also special note 3.


### Privacy and security

    1. I would like to use sample exchange but I would like to keep my sample data private. Can I do that?

Yes, all your data is private, unless you explicitly share it with others.

    2. Is my sample data secure?

Yes! We use bank-grade encryption to store your data in our backend servers. We take security very seriously.

    3. Are there some kinds of samples I am not allowed to share?

Rules around sharing and export control are different for each country. We encourage you to contact a legal firm or an attorney/lawyer if you are not sure. See also special note 3.
